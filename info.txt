1. calculate expected growth rate

CAGR = ((end value/start value)^(1/no. of years)) - 1

2. project future free cash flows (FCF)

current year FCF = x
current year + 1 FCF = x * (1+0.6) = y
current year + 2 FCF = y * (1+0.6)
etc.

3. determine discount rate (WACC or industry averages)

WACC = ((mkt_equity/mkt_equity+mkt_debt)* cost of equity) + ((mkt_debt/mkt_equity+mkt_debt)* cost of debt * (1 - corporate tax rate))

OR

risk-free rate + equity risk premium

4. calculate present value of future cash flows

DCF = sum((FCF_yr_t)/(1+r)^t)
FCF_yr_t = free cash flow in year 18:19
r = discount rate
t = year (1 to 5, for example)

5. calculate terminal value

perpetuity growth method

present value of terminal value

6. total calc

enterprise value (EV) = dcf + pv of terminal value

7. adjust for debt and cash (calculate equity value instead)

equity value = enterprise value - net debt
